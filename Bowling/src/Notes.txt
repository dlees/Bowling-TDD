-After 2nd Test: I’m already seeing a refactoring involving Frames. 
I can see Frame driver holding an array of them, and summing up their scores.  
I see them knowing their own scores. 
But, since what I have now works fine, I should just keep that. 
After all, if there weren’t any more reqs this would be perfect. 
Additionally, I’m not exactly sure how a Frame class would work. 
Future tests will hopefully see this come out.  Should do spares next…

-After “Strike after Spare Passes”, 
I’m honestly even more confused on how the frame system should work than I was after the 2nd test. 
Honestly, the guideline “You know when to refactor when it’s harder to fake it than to implement it right” isn’t helping. 
It’s easier to keep going with what I have for now at least, but it’s so ugly I think.

-After “Test 2 spares in a row”. 
I realize maybe using triangulation more earlier would’ve caught this.

-After refactoring the Frame class out, I’m not liking this. It seems awful. 

-After Strike, Strike, NoMark -- all tests done and passing
Honestly, I was hesitant about an hour ago (before/during the big refactor), 
but it seemed to work out really well. The final frame was a lot easier than I thought it would be
and I probably wouldn't have came up with this solution without TDD.
TDD definitely helped me think of exactly what the algorithm I needed to come up with one step at a time.
 
It's definitely not the prettiest code, but it's alright. The only thing I would really change is
checking for strikes and spares in the FrameDriver just to set the mark. 

Another curious thing (that might make this a bit harder) is if the second roll in the final frame
needs to show its mark. I don't see an API in display to support this, so I'm not implementing it.
